# Java 1 (CSCI 1583)

Wow what a semester. I went from a terminal-based turn-by-turn grid-style game to a full fledge 2D game with weapons.

A lot of this code is very sloppy since I am a beginner. My biggest project (Zombie Apocalypse 2) has been difficult to work with since I started the project in the middle of the semester.
Fortunately this has forced me to see why it's important to really think your code through and design it on a "White-board" before actually developing it.
As I expand on the project adding more and more advanced features, I constantly find myself going back and rewriting old code and/or working around it. 
In the future I hope to have more complete projects with much neater code. I give myself a pass since this is my first semester.

One day when I find the time, I will come back and rewrite all of this to clean it up and exercise my skills.

In the meantime, I will be focusing my attention to future courses to help build upon this semester.
